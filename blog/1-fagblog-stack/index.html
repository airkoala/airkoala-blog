	So I bought this domain a while ago because I wanted my own personal website. Now if you know me you know that I cant just use any off-the-shelf solution. I write my own tools. That was the starting point for this blog.

	At first, I wanted to write a markdown to HTML static site generator in rust. But then I thought about it, why should I translate from one human-readable markup language (markdown) to yet another markup language that is also human-readable (HTML). Yeah sure HTML style tags are kinda annoying to write but it's really not all that bad. Instead of writing <code>**bold text**</code>, is it really that much harder to write <code>&lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;</code>?
